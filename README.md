# Imdb

This project was generated by Shaurya Taneja as part of his ODI at Innovaccer

## Description

This project aims to demonstrate architecture of a simple IMDb replicant website by following views.
1. Login screen (currently dummy data of two users was entered).
2. A Home page depicting the welcome message and Top Releases and Top Rated movies.

## Design Info

1. The Main Component (App Component, initially displaying Login Form only) routes to the Home Component (Home Screen) with 2 instances of Top Component on it (for Top Releases and Top Rated).
2. For Top Releases and Top Rated Movies, a generic parameterised Top Component was used for the purpose.
3. To show data, API calls were made to TMDB (providing free keys to its API, currently the page only displays the brilliant Fight Club).
